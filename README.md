# pynagram3

Pynagram anagram game ported to Python3/PyQt5

Pynagram is a very simple anagram game in Python originally developed by Umang Varma (2009-2011).

The latest version required Python2/PyQt4.

I have now ported it to Python3/PyQt5.

Please, feel free to package it for your favourite distribution.

KNOWN BUGS

Adding word list via the GUI is currently not working properly.
You can still add them manually via configuration files.
